# Difference between Var, Let, and Const.

Suppose the person who develop JavaScript built two versions of it called.

1. ES-5
2. ES-6

Now in ES-5 if you want to declare a variable the only way to do this is by var keyword.

But in ES-6 if you want to declare a variable there are three ways to do this.

1. using var keyword.
2. using let keyword.
3. using const keyword. **This is mainly used for creating constants.**
